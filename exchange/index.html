<h1>Welcome to our University!</h1>
<p>The Fachverein für Publizistik und Kommunikationswissenschaft warmingly welcomes you to our faculty/IPMZ. We are a student asociation voicing interests and appeals of our fellow students, we plan events and strive to create a pleasant community within our faculty/IPMZ. It is our pleasure to have students from all over the globe join our community and we wish to make your transitions to this new environment as easy and enjoyabel as possible.</p>
<br>
<p>A new environment means a new system, and a new system needs getting used to. To make ‚getting used to it’ as simple as possible we summarized all important information below.</p>

<h3>Which Lectures can I (a bachelor-exachange student) attend?</h3>
<p>Principally it is possible for you to attend any lectures which are offered in the Publiszistik Faculty at the UZH. It is important that these lectures are at Bachelor level. If it is in your interest to attend a lecture which has a time span of two semesters (ofcourse only if you are on exchange for more than one semster), then it is your responsibility to formerly contact the Lecturer in charge and clarify whether you have the neccesary knowledge. If this is an issue you are also able to contact the <a href="mailto:mobilitaet@ipmz.uzh.ch" target="_top">‚Mobilitätsvorantwortlichen des IPMZ’</a></p>


<h3>Which Lectures can I (a master-exchange student) attend?</h3>
<p>As a master student you are able to attend any lectures which are offered in the Publizistik Faculty at the UZH (however not ones which belong to a ‚specialized’ master program). This also includes any lectures offered at bachelor level.</p>
<br>
<p>Now that it is clear which lectures come into question, it is important that you book these modules. Only by booking the modules will your attendence and performance be confirmed by the university. <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> <a href="http://www.students.uzh.ch/booking.html">www.students.uzh.ch/booking.html</a></p>

<h3>OLAT!?</h3>
<p>OLAT stands for Online Learning and Training. It is an opensource learning plattform used at our university. This plattform allocates and makes available all learning material for all students of the UZH. In addition forms of kollaborativ learning and communication are encouraged. More information about OLAT can be found <a href="http://www.ipmz.uzh.ch/Studium/elearning/OLAT/InformationenStudierende.html">here.</a></p>

<h3>Transcript of Records</h3>
<p>Whilst completeing your exchange you will be inscribed at the UZH and therefore automatically recieve a transcript of records. Make sure that your email and home adress are up to date before your departure (the transcript will be sent).</p>
<br>
<p>Your future university is a big one. The UZH has buidings that are spread all throughout the city of Zurich. Fortunatley Zurich’s public transport system is reliable and easy to get used to.</p>
<p>Once you know your schedule we definatley recomend you to get familiar with the university set up with the help of the <a href="http://www.plaene.uzh.ch">univesity plans</a>. As an exchange student at our faculty the IPMZ will very likely be your mainadress – so get familiar with Örlikon!</p>
